    "### Ranking by page frequency-random walk frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An example\n",
    "\n",
    "The most successful random walk method has been to perform multiple random walks and combine the pages visited by each one into a single set of pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each random walk traverses a path of pages. Since we perform multiple random walks, we have multiple paths. Some pages will appear on more paths than others. Some pages will appear more frequently per path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: suppose you perform two random walks and each one traverses the following path:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A, C, D, C, X, Y, Z] \n",
    "- [A, C, B, D, Q, P, M]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pages A, C and D are common to both paths. However, C occurs twice on the first path, which no other page does. Hence, C should be ranked first, followed by A and D in joint second. The remaining pages are equally ranked at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Page frequency-path frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the tf-idf (\"term frequency-inverse document frequency\") metric from NLP, we create the tf-df metric, \"term frequency-document frequency\". Translated into random walk parlance, this is \"page frequency-path frequency\". Where \"page frequency\" is the number of occurences of a given page on a given path taken by a random walk, and, \"path frequency\" is the number of random walk paths on which a given page occurs at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically,\n",
    "\n",
    "$pf(r,p)$ is the frequency of page $p$ on a single random walk $r$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{pf}(r,p) = f_{r,p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f_{r,p}$ is the count of a page on a random walk path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path frequency is a measure of how common a given page is to all random walks performed, i.e. if it's common or rare across all random walks,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{rwf}(p,R) = |\\{r \\in R : p \\in r\\}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R$ is the set of paths taken by all random walks and $|\\{r \\in R : p \\in r\\}|$ is the number of random walks on which the page $p$ occurs. For instance, in the above example, page C occurs on two random walk paths."

    "From here, we can compute the page frequency-path frequency metric. We start by constructing an $n\\times m$ matrix, $A$, where $n$ is the number of random walks performed and $m$ is the number of unique pages visited across all random walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $A_{r,p}=f_{r,p}$, i.e. the value on the $p$-th column of the $r$-th row is the the number of occurrences of page $p$ on random walk $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each page, we compute the path frequency score $\\text{rwf}(p,R)$. Doing this for each page gives a vector of length $m$, called $v$, and we convert this into a diagonal matrix: $V=\\text{diag}(v)$, where the elements of $v$ occupy the main diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this, we simply calculate $AV$. This means each $(AV)_{r,p}=f_{r,p} \\text{rwf}(p,R)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to proceed from here, but somehow we need to compress $AV$ down into a vector, where we have a score for each page. We could average each column, we could take the max, the min, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, each page is ranked by the maximum score for its column in $AV$."
