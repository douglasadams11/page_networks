    "- A set of pre-defined pages have been removed from the economic recovery WUJ subgraph\n",
    "- Any pages with less than 10 session hits are removed from the economic recovery WUJ subgraph\n",
    "- Any pages with a shortest page path length equal to or greater than 3 from both `seed0` pages are removed from the economic recovery WUJ subgraph\n",
    "- Any pages where accumulated edge weight is equal to or lower than 20 are removed from the economic recovery WUJ subgraph\n",
    "- Any browse pages not related to the economic recovery WUJ are manually removed from the economic recovery WUJ subgraph\n",

    "OUTPUT: \n",
    "- A csv containing a list of pages related to the economic recovery WUJ. Sorted in ascending order in relation to a composite metric made up of: shortest page path from both `seed0` pages, and degree centrality.\n",
    "  - Additional columns to filter on are included: `document type`, `document supertype`, `number of sessions that visit this page`, `number of sessions where this page is an entrance hit`, `number of sessions where this page is an exit hit`, `distance from /browse/working/finding-job`, `distance from /topic/further-education-skills/apprenticeships`, `the number of pages a user moves to/from between this page and another page in the list`\n",
